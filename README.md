## Introduction

The memory game's deck is made up of 16 shuffled cards, consisting of 8 pairs of matching cards. The objective of this game is to find the 8 pairs of matching cards as fast as you can and with the fewest number of moves possible.


## How to Play

Playing the game is simple, just click on 2 cards at a time to see if they match. If they do, they will stay open, and if they don't, you get to try again to find ones that do match.

And keep an eye on the stars! For every 10 moves you make, you lose a star.

After all 8 pairs of cards have been successfully matched, you win! But the game doesn't have to end here, you can play again!
